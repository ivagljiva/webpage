  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at Illinois
    Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, currently in my fourth and final year. I
    am interested in research questions in computational biology and bioinformatics,
    specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research and interests are
    interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a computer, at heart I consider
    myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and often write computer programs that
    will facilitate my research, but ultimately it is the biologically-relevant
    results of my projects that pique my curiosity and motivate my studies.
