    <h1 id='about'>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at
      Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, currently in my fourth and
      final year. Since 2015, I've been a research assistant in the Pombert Lab as
      well as a teaching assistant in the Computer Science Department. I am
      interested in research questions in computational biology and
      bioinformatics, specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research
      and interests are interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a
      computer, at heart I consider myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and
      often write computer programs that will facilitate my research, but
      ultimately it is the biologically-relevant results of my projects that pique
      my curiosity and motivate my studies.

      <h3>Comparative Genomics of <i>Neisseria</i> Species</h3>
      <p>
        I have sequenced six <i>Neisseria</i> species and am studying how they compare to
        the rest of the genus. I am also investigating the Oxford Nanopore sequencing
        technology, and how it can be used in tandem with Illumina sequencing.

      <h3>SNP Analysis Pipeline</h3>
      <p>
        The Pombert Lab has developed a pipeline that integrates common software for
        read mapping, SNP calling, clustering, and visualization. I worked on a script
        that generates synthetic sequence reads from genome assemblies.

      <h3>Comparative Genomics of <i>Vitreoscilla</i> sp. C1</h3>
      <p>
        The first bacterial hemoglobin was isolated from <i>Vitreoscilla</i> sp. strain C1.
        I sequenced the genome of this species and compared it to its relatives in the
        Neisseriaceae family, including <i>Vitreoscilla stercoraria</i>.

      <h3>Student Cluster Competition 2017</h3>
      <p>
        I am part of a team of students who will be competing in the Student
        Cluster Competition this November. We are profiling and optimizing
        scientific applications so that they will run efficiently and with
        maximum performance on our custom-built cluster during the contest.

      <h3>GUI design for AIGDock</h3>
      <p>
        In Summer 2016, I took part in a web development team project. We designed a
        graphical user interface for AIGDock, a protein-ligand docking software
        developed by Dr. David Minh's lab.

      <h3>Classification of Horizontal Gene Transfer</h3>
      <p>
        For a Machine Learning course in Fall 2016, I developed classification
        models to predict instances of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial
        genomes.

      <h3>Automated Essay Grading</h3>
      <p>
        For a Data Mining course in Spring 2017, my team explored feature
        engineering for accurate score classification of essays and short answer
        responses, which could be used by primary school teachers to provide faster
        feedback to their students.
