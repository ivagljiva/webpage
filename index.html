  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at
    Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, currently in my fourth and
    final year. Since 2015, I've been a research assistant in the Pombert Lab as
    well as a teaching assistant in the Computer Science Department. I am
    interested in research questions in computational biology and
    bioinformatics, specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research
    and interests are interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a
    computer, at heart I consider myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and
    often write computer programs that will facilitate my research, but
    ultimately it is the biologically-relevant results of my projects that pique
    my curiosity and motivate my studies.

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <!--Current projects -->
  <!--TODO: Add italics-->
  <h3>Comparative Genomics of Neisseria Species</h3>
  <p>
    I have sequenced six Neisseria species and am studying how they compare to
    the rest of the genus. I am also investigating the Oxford Nanopore sequencing
    technology, and how it can be used in tandem with Illumina sequencing.
  </p>
  <!--Past projects-->
  <h3>SNP Analysis Pipeline</h3>
  <p>
    The Pombert Lab has developed a pipeline that integrates common software for
    read mapping, SNP calling, clustering, and visualization. I worked on a script
    that generates synthetic sequence reads from genome assemblies.
  </p>
  <h3>Comparative Genomics of Vitreoscilla sp. C1</h3>
  <p>
    The first bacterial hemoglobin was isolated from Vitreoscilla sp. strain C1.
    I sequenced the genome of this species and compared it to its relatives in the
    Neisseriaceae family, including Vitreoscilla stercoraria.

  <h2>Teaching</h2>
  <!--Current courses -->
  <h3>Introduction to Computer Programming</h3>
  <p>
    A C++ class for students not in computer science disciplines. This is my
    second semester teaching the lab section of the course.
  </p>
  <!--Previous courses -->
  <h3>Introduction to Object-oriented Programming</h3>
  <p>
    A Java class for computer science students. I have taught the lab section
    for this course for four semesters so far.
