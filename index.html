  <h1 id='about'>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at
    Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, currently in my fourth and
    final year. Since 2015, I've been a research assistant in the Pombert Lab as
    well as a teaching assistant in the Computer Science Department. I am
    interested in research questions in computational biology and
    bioinformatics, specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research
    and interests are interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a
    computer, at heart I consider myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and
    often write computer programs that will facilitate my research, but
    ultimately it is the biologically-relevant results of my projects that pique
    my curiosity and motivate my studies.

  <h3>Comparative Genomics of Neisseria Species</h3>
  <p>
    I have sequenced six Neisseria species and am studying how they compare to
    the rest of the genus. I am also investigating the Oxford Nanopore sequencing
    technology, and how it can be used in tandem with Illumina sequencing.
  </p>
  <!--Past projects-->
  <h3>SNP Analysis Pipeline</h3>
  <p>
    The Pombert Lab has developed a pipeline that integrates common software for
    read mapping, SNP calling, clustering, and visualization. I worked on a script
    that generates synthetic sequence reads from genome assemblies.
  </p>
  <h3>Comparative Genomics of Vitreoscilla sp. C1</h3>
  <p>
    The first bacterial hemoglobin was isolated from Vitreoscilla sp. strain C1.
    I sequenced the genome of this species and compared it to its relatives in the
    Neisseriaceae family, including Vitreoscilla stercoraria.

  <!--Current courses -->
  <h3>CS105: Introduction to Computer Programming</h3>
  <p>
    A C++ class for students not in computer science disciplines. This is my
    second semester teaching the lab section of the course.
  </p>
  <!--Previous courses -->
  <h3>CS115: Introduction to Object-oriented Programming</h3>
  <p>
    A Java class for computer science students. I have taught the lab section
    for this course for four semesters so far.

  <!--Current projects -->
  <h3>Student Cluster Competition 2017</h3>
  <p>
    I am part of a team of students who will be competing in the Student Cluster
    Competition run by the high-performance computing community this November.
    We are profiling and optimizing scientific applications so that they will
    run efficiently and with maximum performance on our custom-built cluster
    during the contest.
  </p>
  <!--Past projects-->
  <h3>Classification of Horizontal Gene Transfer</h3>
  <p>
    For a Machine Learning course in Fall 2016, I developed classification
    models to predict instances of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial
    genomes.
  </p>
  <h3>Automated Essay Grading</h3>
  <p>
    For a Data Mining course in Spring 2017, my team explored feature
    engineering for accurate score classification of essays and short answer
    responses, which could be used by primary school teachers to provide faster
    feedback to their students.
  </p>
  <h3>GUI design for AIGDock</h3>
  <p>
    In Summer 2016, I took part in a web development team project. We designed a
    graphical user interface for AIGDock, a protein-ligand docking software
    developed by Dr. David Minh's lab.
