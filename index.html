      <p>
        I am a B.S. Biology/M.S. Computer Science co-terminal degree student at
        Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL, currently in my fourth and
        final year. Since 2015, I've been a research assistant in the Pombert Lab as
        well as a teaching assistant in the Computer Science Department. I am
        interested in research questions in computational biology and
        bioinformatics, specifically in the field of genomics. Though my research
        and interests are interdisciplinary and I spend most of my time on a
        computer, at heart I consider myself a biologist - I enjoy programming and
        often write computer programs that will facilitate my research, but
        ultimately it is the biologically-relevant results of my projects that pique
        my curiosity and motivate my studies.

          <h3>Comparative Genomics of <i>Neisseria</i> Species</h3>
          <p>
            I have sequenced six <i>Neisseria</i> species and am studying how they compare to
            the rest of the genus. I am also investigating the Oxford Nanopore sequencing
            technology, and how it can be used in tandem with Illumina sequencing.

          <h3>SNP Analysis Pipeline</h3>
          <p>
            The Pombert Lab has developed a pipeline that integrates common software for
            read mapping, SNP calling, clustering, and visualization. I worked on a script
            that generates synthetic sequence reads from genome assemblies.

          <h3>Comparative Genomics of <i>Vitreoscilla</i> sp. C1</h3>
          <p>
            The first bacterial hemoglobin was isolated from <i>Vitreoscilla</i> sp. strain C1.
            I sequenced the genome of this species and compared it to its relatives in the
            Neisseriaceae family, including <i>Vitreoscilla stercoraria</i>.

          <h3>Student Cluster Competition 2017</h3>
          <p>
            I am part of a team of students who will be competing in the Student
            Cluster Competition this November. We are profiling and optimizing
            scientific applications so that they will run efficiently and with
            maximum performance on our custom-built cluster during the contest.

          <h3>GUI design for AIGDock</h3>
          <p>
            In Summer 2016, I took part in a web development team project. We designed a graphical user
            interface for AIGDock, a protein-ligand docking software developed by Dr. David Minh's lab.
            Our aim was to increase the accessibility of this software for researchers without
            computational backgrounds.

            For a Machine Learning course in Fall 2016, I developed classification
            models to predict instances of horizontal gene transfer in bacterial
            genomes.

            For a Data Mining course in Spring 2017, my team explored feature
            engineering for accurate score classification of essays and short answer
            responses, which could be used by primary school teachers to provide faster
            feedback to their students.
